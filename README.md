# Who is most likely to

## Description
This is a simple website built for anyone who wants to host a 'Who is most likely to' game

## How do I use it?
All you have to do is double click `index.html` and it does the rest! To randomly get a question, press the button at the top of the screen labelled `New Question`

## Can I add my own questions?
Sure! However, you will need some basic programming knowledge. 

Instructions:
- Open `index.jx`
- Locate at the top a constant variable called `questions`
- At the start add a new element like so `['Your question goes here!', 'Most likely to cry over a boy/girl?', etc]`
- That's it! Refresh the website and your question might randomly be selected
